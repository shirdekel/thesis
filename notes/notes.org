** TODO Experiment 8
    - Let's try work backwards:
    - Eventually we need to make a call to `trial_survey_multi_choice`, which creates timeline variables using `set_parameters`.
    - So each iteration of the loop should have a list of two for the two displays
    - I guess we can do everything in tibbles and then in the end nest the two displays (for reliability amount) in the end
      - And convert the two rows to a list
    - So everything can be on big tibble with the following variable columns:
      - Alignment condition
      - Reliability type 
      - Project variation
        - Low alignment: intrinsic features
        - High alignment: project type
    - Then supposedly, filtering that down (and passing the relevant column value to display_if for condition) will get you the two displays for each combination
      - but actually it wouldn't be filtering, it would be stepping down each row and pulling the 'parameters'
    - Actually configuring the two reliability amount displays isn't that easy
      - They need different NPVs
      - Also, they need five new project descriptions
    - New issue
      - You ran Aggregation Experiment 3b (high alignment top up) with the Experiment 4 link.
      - So not the end of the world, but now what you probably need to do is to hard code those three IDs out of Experiment 4 prolific ID generation.
*** TODO Counterbalancing
    - Project variation
      - But this is randomised
    - Project name
      - Is it really just project name that needs latin square?
