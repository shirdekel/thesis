     - Overall good
*** DONE Add explanation for explicit reliability 
    CLOSED: [2020-11-02 Mon 19:14]
    - But: way I call NPV unreliable
      - the implication of that: unreliable because estimates are imperceise
    - precision of the metric prediction
    - Also:
    #+begin_quote
    I would also change "in this particular industry, NPV is an unrelaible
    predictor of project success" to "in this industry, NPV is an unreliable
    predictor of a project's profits"
    #+end_quote
    - Unreliability
      - Good feature some times too
      - Usually it means that there's a greater upside and downside
      - Makes it sound like a bad thing. Whereas when implicitly unreliable
        might be different
        - Unreliable because it's such a wide range of outcomes
          - broader range = meaning we have less confidence
*** Four way interaction
    - Focus on subcomponents
    - If hypotheses only concern a subset
    - Three way interaction for explicit, and no for implicit
      - implies four-way
    - how much more expensive
      - four way is right way to go, other wise have to predict no effect
    - can specify the interactions
*** DONE power analysis
    CLOSED: [2020-11-19 Thu 11:36]
*** Instructions
    - NPV check
      - Maybe part of experiment
      - On a simple task
      - maybe forcing NPV down their throats
      - But actually ok
** Aggregation
*** DONE Send aggregation analyses
    CLOSED: [2020-11-02 Mon 19:14]
    - Thursday - just about aggregation

*** Alignment 
    - People have different meanings on what reliable means
    - Clearer now
    - Not everyone will read and understand
*** Aggregation
    - Giving one at a time
    - Expect risk aversion
      - compared to graph
    - One is telling them 20 projects
      - Other one: not
    - When taking one at a time
    - Question: how does degree of risk aversion compare to distribution
    - Effect of trial
      - Compare awareness for trial 20
      - Compare 1 and 20?
    - Why riskier as it goes?
      - Get gambler's fallacy, but rebound if make it longer
      - "come up heads" will be tails
      - But no feedback. Still trying to even things out
      - Haven't been choosing them, better start choosing them
      - Law of small numbers
      - Give people enough trials: will choose risky option
    - Why not risky things early?
      - Probably risk aversion
    - Important implication
      - Could be big deal
      - If you were looking at gambles and giving feedback
      - People are losing
      - In become riskier
      - Expect to choose riskier things
      - A lot of experiments like that tell people how many rounds there
      - Need to check
      - But we're seeing it without losses
      - Period effect?
    - Hot hand
      - U shaped
      - People think sequence will continue, then against it, then rebound back
        up
      - "Rebound effect"
      - Related to WMC
      - Shifted when you have more capacity
    - Not taking into account shape
    - Similarity effect
      - There are people who see the low as different
      - once you bracket for them they prefer them to be different
*** Analogy
    - Maybe we need more data to address
    - Maybe honours student can follow up
** Actions
*** TODO Aggregation experiments summary 
*** TODO Reanalyse aggregation 4
    - Fix contrasts
    - Try 1 vs 20
    - Try aware vs naive for 20 or last five
    - Try different trends
      - quadratic
      - straight and then linear after half way

** Notes
   - Break down into different effects
   - care about the different effect
   - What effects?
     - explicit: 80
   - Something crazy
     - What if what
     - High null effect BF for alignment in implicit condition
     - Or equivalence
     - Interaction lets you infer
   - total
     - two three-ways
     - one two-way
   - four way only makes sense with other ones
   - if we get
   - Markers
     - Jeff lowenstein
     - Guy who worked with
     - can be strategic about it and get someone to force to read the work

    - explict vs implicit (three-way) - high alignment
    - explict vs implicit (two-way) - low alignment
    - high vs low alignment (three-way) - explicit reliability
    - implicit null effects

   - Annual Progress Review interview
** Notes
   - Covid impact
   - Document impact
   - Tight timeframe
   - Writing motivation varies
   - Not just writing quickly
   - Also feedback
   - Expectations of things to read
   - Consider how important it is to get feedback from everyone
   - "planning on finalising by this date"
   - Team is receptive if impose a deadline
   - Covid
   - If you need a further extension need to document
   - Working environment
   - Potentially extend again
   - Won't be an issue to ask for more time

   - page 2: 400-900 too large?
     - when NPV is higher should have a higher range
     - so it's not dominated
   - page 3:
     - not saying shift to npv, just rely less
     - Just a comment
   - Money:
     - Managers:
       - assuming $30 per person, 13 x 448 = 13,440
     - a lot but we can do it
   - Add "The projects are not correlated"
     - "Each project is indepdent of the others"
   - Why "predicted" project features
     - all good
   - Do we want a limit on allocation per project?
     - Are we getting enough
     - should have minimum allocation for each
   - Figure 7: what's different from previous
   - Should we go to three?
   - should we have payoffs
     - play these things out
     - yes
   - let dan try out experiment
   - table to describe differences
   - values
     - showing the rate is bigger
   - might submit to management science
     - or smj (easier on this)
   - when give the range
     - somehwhere early: say range is uniform distribution
   - whenever there's a dominant choices, e.g. high EV and non overlapping
     range
   - Cap on wednesday

*** DONE add uniform distribution
