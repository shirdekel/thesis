*** Alignment 8
    - Micah
      - Overall good
**** TODO Action #1 Add explanation for explicit reliability             :#1:
     - But: way I call NPV unreliable
       - the implication of that: unreliable because estimates are imperceise
     - precision of the metric prediction
     - Also:
     #+begin_quote
     I would also change "in this particular industry, NPV is an unrelaible
     predictor of project success" to "in this industry, NPV is an unreliable
     predictor of a project's profits"
     #+end_quote
     - Unreliability
       - Good feature some times too
       - Usually it means that there's a greater upside and downside
       - Makes it sound like a bad thing. Whereas when implicitly unreliable
         might be different
         - Unreliable because it's such a wide range of outcomes
           - broader range = meaning we have less confidence
**** Four way interaction
     - Focus on subcomponents
     - If hypotheses only concern a subset
     - Three way interaction for explicit, and no for implicit
       - implies four-way
     - how much more expensive
       - four way is right way to go, other wise have to predict no effect
     - can specify the interactions
**** TODO Action #2 power analysis                                       :#2:
**** Instructions
     - NPV check
       - Maybe part of experiment
       - On a simple task
       - maybe forcing NPV down their throats
       - But actually ok
*** Aggregation
**** TODO Action #3 Send aggregation analyses                            :#3:
     - Thursday - just about aggregation

** Present at meeting
   - [X] Dan
   - [X] Bruce
** Notes
*** Alignment 
    - People have different meanings on what reliable means
    - Clearer now
    - Not everyone will read and understand
**** TODO Action #5 Reanalyse aggregation 4                             :#5:
     - Fix contrasts
     - Try 1 vs 20
     - Try aware vs naive for 20 or last five
     - Try different trends
       - quadratic
       - straight and then linear after half way
*** Aggregation
    - Giving one at a time
    - Expect risk aversion
      - compared to graph
    - One is telling them 20 projects
      - Other one: not
    - When taking one at a time
    - Question: how does degree of risk aversion compare to distribution
    - Effect of trial
      - Compare awareness for trial 20
      - Compare 1 and 20?
    - Why riskier as it goes?
      - Get gambler's fallacy, but rebound if make it longer
      - "come up heads" will be tails
      - But no feedback. Still trying to even things out
      - Haven't been choosing them, better start choosing them
      - Law of small numbers
      - Give people enough trials: will choose risky option
    - Why not risky things early?
      - Probably risk aversion
    - Important implication
      - Could be big deal
      - If you were looking at gambles and giving feedback
      - People are losing
      - In become riskier
      - Expect to choose riskier things
      - A lot of experiments like that tell people how many rounds there
      - Need to check
      - But we're seeing it without losses
      - Period effect?
    - Hot hand
      - U shaped
      - People think sequence will continue, then against it, then rebound back
        up
      - "Rebound effect"
      - Related to WMC
      - Shifted when you have more capacity
    - Not taking into account shape
    - Similarity effect
      - There are people who see the low as different
      - once you bracket for them they prefer them to be different
**** TODO Action #4 Aggregation experiments summary                      :#4:
*** Analogy
    - Maybe we need more data to address
    - Maybe honours student can follow up

** Present at meeting
   - [X] Micah
** Notes
   - Break down into different effects
   - care about the different effect
   - What effects?
     - explicit: 80
   - Something crazy
     - What if what
     - High null effect BF for alignment in implicit condition
     - Or equivalence
     - Interaction lets you infer
   - total
     - two three-ways
     - one two-way
   - four way only makes sense with other ones
   - if we get
   - Markers
     - Jeff lowenstein
     - Guy who worked with
     - can be strategic about it and get someone to force to read the work
*** TODO Action #6 Check about HDR funds                                 :#6:
*** TODO Action #7 Ask Dan if he can answer Rob's question               :#7:
*** TODO Action #8 Run specific power analyses                           :#8:
    - explict vs implicit (three-way) - high alignment
    - explict vs implicit (two-way) - low alignment
    - high vs low alignment (three-way) - explicit reliability
    - implicit null effects

   - page 2: 400-900 too large?
     - when NPV is higher should have a higher range
     - so it's not dominated
   - page 3:
     - not saying shift to npv, just rely less
     - Just a comment
   - Money:
     - Managers:
       - assuming $30 per person, 13 x 448 = 13,440
     - a lot but we can do it
   - Add "The projects are not correlated"
     - "Each project is indepdent of the others"
   - Why "predicted" project features
     - all good
   - Do we want a limit on allocation per project?
     - Are we getting enough
     - should have minimum allocation for each
   - Figure 7: what's different from previous
   - Should we go to three?
   - should we have payoffs
     - play these things out
     - yes
   - let dan try out experiment
   - table to describe differences
   - values
     - showing the rate is bigger
   - might submit to management science
     - or smj (easier on this)
   - when give the range
     - somehwhere early: say range is uniform distribution
   - whenever there's a dominant choices, e.g. high EV and non overlapping
     range
   - Cap on wednesday

*** Rob comment                                                         :#16:
    - Rob was saying that global similarity is still not necessarily a bad thing,
      even if randomly sample
    - Certainly can diminish
    - Will want an argument
    - Want to minimise other concerns (randomly selected)
    - But also other argument against it
    - Starting with premise that aggregated data is better than cases
    - But need to justify the assumption
    - Medical case: no reason to consider. Because random
    - But here, by manipulating similarity, we are introducing that there are
      high similarity examples
      - So why not go for high similarity.
    - Even if it's random, and it's one of the most similar one in the pool
    - e.g., 
    - Twin: causal relationship and mechanism
      - Same genetics
      - similarity in biology
      - Extreme example
      - May have other factor
    - Need to make argument that ignoring data is normative
    - Make it clear, rather than assuming
**** Case-based literature
     - Shenkin,
     - janet clodner/rodner
     - Saw link between this and analogy
     - wider view of cases
     - didn't always have to be analogy
     - problem with that work: hard to define when it should help and when
       shouldn't
     - empirically test most effective wasn't important
     - illustrates: sometimes people will use anecdotes. not always easy when
       they like to use
     - case based: causal reasoning. when it gave you good causal argument
**** Relative parameters
     - Experiment 1 Ratings: variation about how relevant. relevance were related to
       similarity.
     - Does appear to be causal reasoning
     - One of the reasons why interested: some work where negative anecdote
       affected because causal reasoning, or whether it gives people a negative
       association.
     - Both could be there
       - Even if investment has little relevance, probably does lower investment
     - By manipulating similarity, we might have been making normative case for
       the anecdote
       - Unless we can make the case that the anecdote should be ignored, even
         given this specific detail, then maybe we want to similarity in more
         irrelevant ways.
       - E.g., incompetent manager
     - If we say it failed because number, etc.
       - unless we make it clear that it's not deterministic of failure.
     - Seem to be contrasting anecdotes and data
       - Independent effect of anecdotes and statistics
     - Dan: managers that are seduced by the allure of the case, vs analysis
       - One company that bucked the trend
     - If the statistics are close vs far
       - relative strength which determines the outcome
       - But assumption: people would be overweighing anecdotes
       - But how to define overweighing
*** Connection to base rate neglect                                     :#14:
    - Base rate neglect and representativeness
      - If statistics with neutral case, then 50/50
      - They only use statistics, if had nothing else
      - If you give people a neutral description, then less impact of statistics
        than if by themselves.
    - Can set up situation where there is a clear answer
      - but then it's just extreme, and not the usual grey
    - car reliability
      - Consumer reports: based on 100 000 cases
      - Car X is more reliable than Car Y
      - One friend tells you Car Y is better
      - Anecdote will influence
      - People should be going with statistics
      - But if all you had was 10 cases, limited edition, then maybe the story is relevant
    - Easier to argue when you manipulate variable, have less or than impact
    - Recommendation to managers
      - Fine
    - But teasing apart effect
      - Doesnt need
    - Not always ignore
      - Overweight anecdotes
    - Representativeness heuristic
    - Bob the engineer vs lawyers
      - But: category/essence thing
    - Works as intuition engine
      - Even if it doesn't switch choice, will make you think about it
      - more cautious
      - Normally not a strong effect
    - Medicine
      - Women's health anecdotes affect women more than men
    - Tom Von Leer
      - Studies narratives
      - Social professor of narratology
*** Narratives
    - Work on coherence and reasoning
    - Information presented in coherent way
    - Expect trip advisor stories to have better impact
    - But also could be that the more it's a story the more likely it's a story
      or to this it's real
    - Draws you in
    - Coherence stuff: how much people were effected by coherence across instances?
      - Evaluating political messages: incoherent with other point of view
      - But would people notice?
      - If you're not the expert
      - Paul Thagard was analysing coherence
        - How decision of ship thinking under attack from F15
        - Different bits of information, came to support single story
        - But some ambiguous information was changed to be more coherent
        - So different information can be made to be more coherent
        - "Vincence"?
      - E.g., biden says supporting healthcare but not healthcare for all
*** Analysis                                                            :#15:
    - Can have internal analysis, but then also specific comparison to baseline
    - Not a problem, becaues have no choice
    - Fine to do separate analysis
    - But no specific estimate
    - But DV
    - Could do differnce score?
      - Seems like noisy measure
      - If could get lots of statistics to get baseline
      - But since one can throw things out
      - Needs confidence that they are really the baseline
    - Conceptually works, but might be adding more noise that need
    - If just doing that comparison
      - if statistics compared to high
    - could just do comparison to low sim
    - could do odds ratio terms
      - aggregated across people?
    - Putting in terms of dollar values is specific to experiment
      - The odds of choosing the one that the statistics support is reduced by
        X when high similarity anecdote etc.
    - Could still in prose say that size of effect a is x and effect b is y
    - if you have five groups, and
    - "non fully factorial"
      - But you have a reason why
      - And have hypotheses
*** TODO Action #14 Look into base rate neglect literature              :#14:
    - like car reliability example
*** TODO Action #15 Analyse anecdotes 2 as specific hypotheses          :#15:
    - And infer the interactions
    - So essentially like the stats consultant said
*** TODO Action #16 Clarify that anecdotes are sampled randomly         :#16:
*** TODO Action #17 Justify normative case for aggregated data          :#17:
    - Within our specific parameters
    - e.g., of large number of cases

*** rob's comment                                                       :#19:
    - if the other things aren't similar
    - movie study
      - rate similarity of movie to focal movie
      - more weight when similar
    - you can either state that, or that they're all equally similar
    - or third option: list all of the things in the dataset
    - randomly sampled
      - but could be still more similar
      - way around it: say that all of the anecdotes are equally similar to the
    focal case.
    - Not a crazy thing: with reference-class forecasting (kahneman and tversky,
    and dan), each case is counted equally
    - Refined further: different weights on different cases
    - do 1-7 instead of 1-6
**** TODO Action #19 Work out whether to use a six or seven point scale :#19:
     - For anecdotes ratings
*** anecdotes 1                                                         :#20:
    - Rob is right
    - Now understands what he's saying, so not sure what to do
    - If something is more similar, you might have to use it more
    - We've only got two anecdotes
      - In both cases, people pay too much attention to anecdote
    - Do we tell them how many
    - Talk about later today
    - One way to get around it: say something like
      - this example falls within X range, i.e., +- 40-60% percentile
      - Make sure it shouldn't have influence
    - Would be great to have the right weight
      - how much should, if you had similarity ratings of all projects
      - There is a correct weight of how much influence it should have on decision
    - We can also describe the distribution of how similar the projects are
    - And then maybe the randomly choosing
    - If you say it's random distribution, and we define what the highest
    similarity could be. and if the highest similarity isn't .96 but it's .8 then we
    can say that anytihng that's been chosen 
    - instead of cutting off on percentiles. the most similar isn't all that similar.
    - unifrom distribution. experts similarity distribution .3-.8
**** TODO Action #20 Update others with ideas to respond to Rob         :#20:
     - randomly sampled
     - large pool
     - specific company
     - constraining range of possible similarity in the pool

   - How to deal with the normative Anecdotes question?
** Notes
*** Maybe sometimes anecdotes are ok                                    :#22:
    - "actually what people do is sensitive"
    - perhaps a flip
      - assumption that people should ignore anecdote
      - business people should only listen
      - But what people are doing is sensible
      - Not just hearing a story and getting scared, but sensible creating causal
      story and applying that across
    - And also, take and statistics and anecote into account
      - there is a seductive allure/emotion/visual richness
      - emotional content
      - However, actually when anecdote is highly similar that applies across
    cases, and still take the statistics into account
    - if that's the case, maybe not second study
    - whole literature on narratives
      - narativologist: when in narrative people can't help themselves
      - e.g., if person is brain dead and then comes to life, people still
    believe it even if you tell them
    - people compelled by stories
    - can say people say it's bad
      - But when it comes to investment people are perhaps doing more sensible things
      - If that's the argument, you actually do the manipulation of causally
    clear vs not
    - generalising causal explanation
    - good or bad:
    - But is explanation legit?
      - future manipulation
**** TODO Action #22 Write explanation of new anecdote argument         :#22:
     - Including why valence still is useful
       - Maybe because previously it mattered for health
       - But because people appear sensitive to details, it shouldn't matter
     - Still with random sampling
*** Relevance question                                                  :#23:
    - is it clear that the reason for the failure applies here
    - could be another question: do you think it's a concern about this
      - or the reason could apply here
    - But multiple displays?
      - should be ok with counterbalancing
      - if not, use the first
**** TODO Action #23 Change anecdote relevance question                 :#23:
*** Valence                                                             :#22:
    - Hearing bad stories make you risk
    - does a negative story peak your risk aversion
    - But if you say that there are parallels in positive and negative, showing
    that it isn't just about a negative story
    - If we're saying it's bad, then "what context does it appear in"
      - naive, not thinking about causal mechanism
      - is it allure via negative scared of risk
    - If doing causal reasoning thing, then you're already sensitive to details
*** Follow up experiment                                                :#24:
    - In this case maybe people "kind of get it"
      - so no need for follow up
    - If I want to make case it's causal
    - What's the point I'm going to make
      - New point
      - People are sensibly doing this?
        - causal reasoning
      - Do you then do something simple where you make it more clear that it's
    about causality
    - Same as before
      - in terms of analysis descriptions
**** TODO Action #24 Add anecdote analysis descriptions                 :#24:
     - as before
*** Random sampling                                                     :#22:
    - If we want to show smart
    - need random sampling
    - eliminates social pragmatic thing

    - can say hey, if you want to get rid of it
      - normative claim is an open question
      - Actually a form of causal induction

    - then anecdote should have more weight
    - way to solve it
      - sbp
      - and robust analogising
      - has equation: weight on similarity = similarity of i/sum of similarity
        of all weight
      - or gilboa/ david schmidler paper?
*** TODO Action #26 Read Gilboa and Schmidler paper                     :#26:
*** Flipped argument                                                    :#28:
    - If we're making case: isn't weird that people are doing dumb thing in face
    of data
    - but maybe they should to a certain degree
    - So maybe instead how dumb people are:
      - Even though there's this general notion that anecdotal thinkjing in bad
      - well in this situation there's  acase in which: one way in which they're bad, they give you a negative feeling
      - hearing about a failed investment. prime failure. risk aversion
      - different to similarity based forcasting: considering why each one failed
      - here's why they apply
      - They didn't ignore statistics in high similarity
        - integrated
        - maybe right thing to do
      - or: has to address that they're doing causal reasoning thing
      - not: seeing failure makes me scared
*** Dan's idea                                                          :#27:
    - in some sense you compare similarity features without outcome
      - outcome helpsyou make prediction
      - features of case without knowing outcome. then you hear about the outcome
      - that outcome helps you makes prediction. but not part of similarity
      - outcome is independent of what makes them similar?
        - yeah
      - how do you make it clear that it's irrelevant
      - if the two main parametrs:
        - average simialarity
        - how similar this is in comparison
      - then instead of high vs low similarity, then we have a way of seeing if they're overweighting or not
        - nicely links: understanding variability and distributions
      - if the two levers to pull are: instance similarity and average similarity in the distribution
        - get rid of valence?
          - could be an issue
*** Real life recommendation                                            :#27:
    - Should integrate similarity
    - just matters the weight
    - seems to be what people were doing
    - don't know if their gredations of weight are like formula
    - treating high similarity case as heavier weighted
    - but: don't want to say
      - these things are still 1/1000
      - we want to know what the average similarity is and then how much more similar this one is
      - without knowing distribution you don't know how to do systematically
*** parameters                                                          :#27:
    - there's both size of sample of cases
      - 5 vs 1000
      - more cases the more you should weigh
    - average similarity
    - a few lines of
      - these are the things that go into calculation of similarity
      - calculated by these aspect
    - if you give someone similarity score
      - there are 1000.
      - average similarity is .3, and this one is .7
      - vs 10 cases
    - similarity
      - think probability
*** TODO Action #27 Write plan for new anecdotes experiment             :#27:
*** maybe different point                                               :#27:
    - causal connection: similarity helps generate explanation for why something failed
    - if you're directly testing this other (similarity based forecastng)
      - would set it up like aggregation.
      - series of judgement
      - minimise actual description
    - but the story makes them overweigh
      - still need story
    - worth to read paper
*** minimum manipulation for new thing                                  :#27:
    - low average similarity high simliarity
    - low vs high pool size
*** actual
    - testing whether similarity is about causal thing
    - other thing: to do with grant
*** TODO Action #25 reread robust analogising                           :#25:
    - section called similarity based forecasting
    - come back with ideas
*** ARC                                                                 :#27:
    - internal deadline: feb 10
    - used to be end of march
    - But still outcomes in Nov
    - Was going to add something about measuring aggregation
    - Micah already on 2: from last year and other thing
    - If kahneman was on it track record would be fine
    - research office gives feedback
    - first strategic review: Jan 7
      - for two rounds
    - Second: Jan 13th
    - Will get started
    - Feb 10 is the hard deadline for compliance
    - can keep working on it till 20th
    - Area: SBE
      - social behavioural economic
      - within: depending how you pitch it will go to certain reviewers
*** TODO Action #28 Send update about Anecdotes 2                       :#28:
    - After reading recommended papers
    - If can't find something to fix the normative problem, then say that we're
      just going to do as before and change the argument
*** normative question again                                            :#28:
    - can say that they're all equally similar
    - people's simliarity ratings predicted relevance
    - makes sense if they're doing causal reasoning thing
    - if these things share intrinsic features, then they can fail for same reasons
    - if you have evidence validating of similarity ratings
      - then isn't that enough
    - but: no direct way to measure similarity to whole
      - if this is one case from distribution.
      - don't know how similar the other cases
      - don't know how representative
*** Typicality                                                          :#28:
    - can ask about typicality
      - is this a typical case
      - in a way general relevance gets at that
      - but could also say how typical do you think this is
      - in terms of its features: how typical do you think this is of the 1000 cases
      - asserting: they're seeing it as more or less typical
      - if they don't understand, they might not be considering what distribution is
    - but: how would they know what to say
    - just need to establish
    - can also do a version of what bruce recommended
      - similarity ratings

** Notes
*** Risk consistency                                                    :#31:
    - Another name for RAT
    - Might have to contact school
    - as you move down hierarchies, you get bigger differences between CEO and
      person
    - Tying to innovation because "the ARC loves that shit"
*** TODO Action #31 Add risk consistency/RAT detail to grant            :#31:
*** How did they calculate RAT?                                         :#31:
    - Like the Thaler questions
    - Read Swalm 1966
    - Framed differently to different levels
    - Had it programmed
      - But might have to redo
    - Done with former PhD student, but didn't publish
    - Different magnitudes
    - Old doctoral student has data
    - But just say 32%
*** TODO Action #32 Add interview detail to grant                       :#32:
*** What should the interviews be about?                                :#32:
    - Part of same project
    - When we find people are being excessively loss/risk averse lower down in
      the organisation
    - find out why they're being that way
    - particularly for new ideas
      - R&D, new projects
    - Expect to say they don't want to risk job
    - Important to hit innovation angle
    - Step one is online survey, step 2 interview people
      - diagnostic, then more in depth interview about situation and ways to
        overcome it
      - But people at lower level and higher level
*** TODO Action #33 Send new project description draft                  :#33:
*** Grant                                                               :#33:
    - "uniqueness bias"
    - submitted grants all over the place
    - initially focused on bold forecast part
    - timid decision making not followed up
    - didn't give enough
    - to be fair to everyone
    - but why not bet on big horses
*** TODO Action #34 Add detail to incentive structure experiment        :#34:
*** incentive structures                                                :#34:
    - Experimental
    - or for practitioners?
    - But: we don't want it to seem like we're doing consulting work
      - need to figure way around that
      - because they won't like that
      - focus on the australian business aspect
      - mainly how a lot of these lower level projects are innovative risky new innovations
*** TODO Action #35 Ask Micah about participant sample                  :#35:
*** TODO Action #36 Use previous experiment pilots                      :#36:
    - Distribution and similarity?
    - First draft: put more in rather than less
    - even if ambiguous and have idea why ambiguous, then can still add
    - nothing that can hurt us
*** Add to front                                                    :#29:#33:
    - go thorugh that other people did htis with immediate feedback: say what
      they found
    - problem: not isomorphic to business
    - Except for things than change by the day e.g., google
    - Austrlia is resource economy, e.g., don't get feedback on mining
    - get data: percentage of business in asutrlia that is done by large companies
    - almost everytiung is oligopaly/duopoly
    - resource sector: not industries with lots of players
    - "large business" rahter than small medium
    - a lopt of innovation takes place in large companies
*** TODO Action #29 get percentage of revenue and employment for large vs sme :#29:
    - if not can push through anecote
    - in australia there are four bank, two airlines, vs elsewhere
    - resource secotr: dominated by large companies
      - revenues are dominated
*** area of interest                                                    :#33:
    - multiple levels of hierarchies
    - are they taking the number of risky bets that makes sense to CEO
    - one way for them to take those riskier bets is to understand about aggregation
    - intellectual and practical conserns
*** studies                                                             :#33:
    - Would use broader terms "cost of risk aversion to austrlian companies
      especially in risky bets"
    - tool that can use
    - once we see where the problems are, we go to in to the companies
    - and then also after the decision aids
    - RAT + interviews, things that change risk preferences, interventions
    - give a feel for experiemnts, e.g., what the questions are
    - similarity: once we bracket for them, they diversify
*** decision aids                                                       :#33:
    - interactive tool
    - worried theyd think it's too consulting
*** survey                                                              :#32:
    - for each company, the survey needs to be adjusted to fit the industry and company
*** job
    - any one job is not likely
    - salary: assume 100k
    - maybe better to CBA for almost a year and then come back
    - think I'd porbably better coming back
    - McKinsey will eat you up in terms of time
    - work cloes to americans
    - notice period: would call and ask
    - "would be happy to discuss at the interview"
    - find out what senior lecturer makes and mckinsey
    - don't want to price yourself out
    - say somethink like "salary consistent with PhD credential and value you
      think I could add to the company"
*** grant                                                               :#33:
    - two for two, and not had kahneman
*** TODO Action #30 draft budget                                        :#30:
    - budget: go over
    - See what the highest pay for postdoc
*** feedback
    - doing a good job

   - [X] Micah
** Agenda
   - Grant application
** Notes
*** Title
    - Too long for online application
*** Participants
    - Kahneman email
    - Institution approval?
    - Need him to register in RMS
*** Objectives
    - Can they just be the same as the aims?
*** FOR
    - Codes
    - Percentages
*** basic question
    - Because the RAT doesn't directly assess aggregation, we have to do somethign at the begining
    - logic
      - show orgs don't do this
      - show things that help
      - and end iwth we can help you
    - problem: had gap between identifying the problem and doing the studies
    - don't we have to establish that they aren't aggregating properly
    - difference between not applying aggregation knowledge because different times
      - from not being aware of aggregation
    - choice bracketing didn't work for naive
    - first org then large sample studies
      - why not get
*** deadlines
    - Feb 10: finish everything but project description
*** interest
    - Rule out left wing humanity
    - our project is in line with all the capitalist principles
*** TODO Action #37 Get started on other grant sections                 :#37:

** Agenda
   - Grant application
** Notes
*** Get kahneman to get RMS and ROPE
*** Priorities
    - None of research priorities really apply to social sciences anyway
    - So maybe rely on the innovation priorities from industry instead
*** FOR
    - For reviewers, so need to ask Dan
*** SEO
    - expanding knoweldge not needed.
    - Used for when you don't have anything else
*** interdisciplanary
    - if say yes and it's psych + mangement
    - so it's fine
    - Not fine for FOR
*** international
    - Bringing kahneman to sydney
*** conference
    - Probably don't ask for two
*** equipment
    - Justify computers with computing power for simulations and aggregation tool
*** sample sizes
    - if can justify then helpful
*** TODO Action #38 Create list of things we need from Dan              :#38:
* Actions
** DONE Action #1 Add explanation for explicit reliability               :#1:
   CLOSED: [2020-11-02 Mon 19:14]
   - But: way I call NPV unreliable
     - the implication of that: unreliable because estimates are imperceise
   - precision of the metric prediction
   - Also:
   #+begin_quote
   I would also change "in this particular industry, NPV is an unrelaible
   predictor of project success" to "in this industry, NPV is an unreliable
   predictor of a project's profits"
   #+end_quote
   - Unreliability
     - Good feature some times too
     - Usually it means that there's a greater upside and downside
     - Makes it sound like a bad thing. Whereas when implicitly unreliable
       might be different
       - Unreliable because it's such a wide range of outcomes
         - broader range = meaning we have less confidence

     Here, single analogy forecasts could actually be ideal if there exists only
     one highly similar case with all other cases rated only moderately similar.
     For cases where there is potentially more than one highly similar case, the
     ‘multi analogy forecast’ based on similarity weighting will probably result
     in a more accurate prediction.

     - Sounds like the idea that some times anecdotes should be used
       - The nuance here is that this is the case not only when the anecdote is
         similar, but also when the others in the pool are dissimilar by a lot.
       - so can just tell participants that there are other similar cases in the pool
       - we can say that the other projects in the pool were rated as equally
         similar to the target
