*** Alignment 8
    - Micah
      - Overall good
**** TODO Action #1 Add explanation for explicit reliability             :#1:
     - But: way I call NPV unreliable
       - the implication of that: unreliable because estimates are imperceise
     - precision of the metric prediction
     - Also:
     #+begin_quote
     I would also change "in this particular industry, NPV is an unrelaible
     predictor of project success" to "in this industry, NPV is an unreliable
     predictor of a project's profits"
     #+end_quote
     - Unreliability
       - Good feature some times too
       - Usually it means that there's a greater upside and downside
       - Makes it sound like a bad thing. Whereas when implicitly unreliable
         might be different
         - Unreliable because it's such a wide range of outcomes
           - broader range = meaning we have less confidence
**** Four way interaction
     - Focus on subcomponents
     - If hypotheses only concern a subset
     - Three way interaction for explicit, and no for implicit
       - implies four-way
     - how much more expensive
       - four way is right way to go, other wise have to predict no effect
     - can specify the interactions
**** TODO Action #2 power analysis                                       :#2:
**** Instructions
     - NPV check
       - Maybe part of experiment
       - On a simple task
       - maybe forcing NPV down their throats
       - But actually ok
*** Aggregation
**** TODO Action #3 Send aggregation analyses                            :#3:
     - Thursday - just about aggregation

** Present at meeting
   - [X] Dan
   - [X] Bruce
** Notes
*** Alignment 
    - People have different meanings on what reliable means
    - Clearer now
    - Not everyone will read and understand
**** TODO Action #5 Reanalyse aggregation 4                             :#5:
     - Fix contrasts
     - Try 1 vs 20
     - Try aware vs naive for 20 or last five
     - Try different trends
       - quadratic
       - straight and then linear after half way
*** Aggregation
    - Giving one at a time
    - Expect risk aversion
      - compared to graph
    - One is telling them 20 projects
      - Other one: not
    - When taking one at a time
    - Question: how does degree of risk aversion compare to distribution
    - Effect of trial
      - Compare awareness for trial 20
      - Compare 1 and 20?
    - Why riskier as it goes?
      - Get gambler's fallacy, but rebound if make it longer
      - "come up heads" will be tails
      - But no feedback. Still trying to even things out
      - Haven't been choosing them, better start choosing them
      - Law of small numbers
      - Give people enough trials: will choose risky option
    - Why not risky things early?
      - Probably risk aversion
    - Important implication
      - Could be big deal
      - If you were looking at gambles and giving feedback
      - People are losing
      - In become riskier
      - Expect to choose riskier things
      - A lot of experiments like that tell people how many rounds there
      - Need to check
      - But we're seeing it without losses
      - Period effect?
    - Hot hand
      - U shaped
      - People think sequence will continue, then against it, then rebound back
        up
      - "Rebound effect"
      - Related to WMC
      - Shifted when you have more capacity
    - Not taking into account shape
    - Similarity effect
      - There are people who see the low as different
      - once you bracket for them they prefer them to be different
**** TODO Action #4 Aggregation experiments summary                      :#4:
*** Analogy
    - Maybe we need more data to address
    - Maybe honours student can follow up

** Present at meeting
   - [X] Micah
** Notes
   - Break down into different effects
   - care about the different effect
   - What effects?
     - explicit: 80
   - Something crazy
     - What if what
     - High null effect BF for alignment in implicit condition
     - Or equivalence
     - Interaction lets you infer
   - total
     - two three-ways
     - one two-way
   - four way only makes sense with other ones
   - if we get
   - Markers
     - Jeff lowenstein
     - Guy who worked with
     - can be strategic about it and get someone to force to read the work
*** TODO Action #6 Check about HDR funds                                 :#6:
*** TODO Action #7 Ask Dan if he can answer Rob's question               :#7:
*** TODO Action #8 Run specific power analyses                           :#8:
    - explict vs implicit (three-way) - high alignment
    - explict vs implicit (two-way) - low alignment
    - high vs low alignment (three-way) - explicit reliability
    - implicit null effects

** Present at meeting
   - [X] Evan Livesey
   - [X] Daniel Costa
** Agenda
   - Annual Progress Review interview
** Notes
   - Covid impact
   - Document impact
   - Tight timeframe
   - Writing motivation varies
   - Not just writing quickly
   - Also feedback
   - Expectations of things to read
   - Consider how important it is to get feedback from everyone
   - "planning on finalising by this date"
   - Team is receptive if impose a deadline
   - Covid
   - If you need a further extension need to document
   - Working environment
   - Potentially extend again
   - Won't be an issue to ask for more time
*** TODO Action #9 Work out plan of when to get drafts back to me        :#9:

   - RA and McKinsey payments
** Notes
   - page 2: 400-900 too large?
     - when NPV is higher should have a higher range
     - so it's not dominated
   - page 3:
     - not saying shift to npv, just rely less
     - Just a comment
   - Money:
     - Managers:
       - assuming $30 per person, 13 x 448 = 13,440
     - a lot but we can do it
   - Add "The projects are not correlated"
     - "Each project is indepdent of the others"
   - Why "predicted" project features
     - all good
   - Do we want a limit on allocation per project?
     - Are we getting enough
     - should have minimum allocation for each
   - Figure 7: what's different from previous
   - Should we go to three?
   - should we have payoffs
     - play these things out
     - yes
   - let dan try out experiment
   - table to describe differences
   - values
     - showing the rate is bigger
   - might submit to management science
     - or smj (easier on this)
   - when give the range
     - somehwhere early: say range is uniform distribution
   - whenever there's a dominant choices, e.g. high EV and non overlapping
     range
   - Cap on wednesday
