- Hello, my name is Shir and this is a prerecorded presentation for the 2021
Meeting of the Australasian Mathematical Psychology Conference.
- I will start with some background, describe one of our studies, and summarise
  the results.

- So, imagine you're tasked with evaluating research projects for a philanthropic organisation.
  - Your job is to allocate funds to the best projects and the two finalists are
    from a molecular biologist and an historian.
- How do you work out how to allocate the funds?
  - The projects are different in so many ways.
- One way is to use something like the lead investigator's h-index.
  - But you can imagine that molecular biology may have very different
    publishing rates and output types than history.
  - In other words, the metric doesn't have the same reliability across disciplines
  - Maybe in disciplines for which it has a lower reliability you can weight
    other metrics higher.
- On the other hand, it would be a lot easier to compare across two molecular
  biology projects, because they would be more biology-specific elements to
  compare.

- In our work we are interested in this kind of scenario but in a business
  context.
- Many companies are diversified, meaning that they often need to allocate
    resources across very dissimilar business units.
  - For example, even if you were a manager at an oil company, how would you go
    about allocating funds between an oil well project and a refinery project?
    - They're both about oil, but the outputs are very hard to compare.

- This situation has financial implications, with one study finding that those
  managing portfolios of financially similar businesses are 20 percent more
  likely than those managing financially dissimilar portfolios to describe
  themselves as more profitable and faster growing than their peers.
  - @koller2017
- If companies just had to compare between two oil wells, then a metric such as
  "litres of oil per hour" could be used to measure a well's efficiency.
- Without this, companies need to rely on more abstract financial metrics.
  - But these introduce more noise.

- Managers often deal with this problem by using metrics such as Net Present
  Value, or NPV.
- NPV is the amount of money you think a project is going to make minus the money you spent on it.

???

- This is a very popular metric.
- But just like h-index reliability varies across domains

---

## Previous work

???

- There isn't much research on this topic, but there are a few suggestive lines
  of work.

--

### Project similarity bias

- Alignable differences are more important than non-alignable differences
  - More weight in judgements of similarity .small[`r Citep(bib, "markman1993")`]

  - Easier to list .small[`r Citep(bib, "gentner2001")`]
  - Used more for decision making .small[`r Citep(bib, "markman1995", "markman2010")`]

???

- For one, we know that people evaluate options differently based on how easy it
  is to compare across them.
  - Specifically, options that share metrics are easier to compare.

--

### Variance neglect

- People are not good at using variance information .small[`r Citep(bib, before = "e.g., ", "konold1989")`]
  - Specifically with forecasting .small[`r Citep(bib, "vivalt2018", "batteux2020")`]

- e.g., which forecaster would you listen to?
  - A: 19-21˚C (mean = 20)
  - B: 3-37˚C (mean = 20)

???

- Also, we know that people often struggle with variance information.
  - Even though it should be intuitively clear that a forecast with a smaller
    range of values is likely to be more reliable than one with a greater range.

# The current study

## Research questions

- Does project similarity affect people's evaluation of projects that have
  the same forecasts?

???

- We are interested in the effects of how similar a set of projects are to each
  other on people's use of financial forecast metrics.

--

- Do people use reliability information to inform their evaluations?

???

- We are also interested in, if they do choose to use a forecast metric, whether
  they moderate their use based on the variance information provided.

background-size: contain

???

- This is an example of the display participants saw.
- You can see how we asked them to respond, and the way we displayed the five
  projects, and the relevant information about them.

---

## Design

???

- We manipulated a few variables.

--

Independent variables

- Alignment (between-subjects)
  - High
  - Low

???

- Whether the five projects were all from the same domain or from five different
  ones.

--

- Reliability type (between-subjects)
  - Verbal
  - Numerical

???

- Whether NPV reliability was expressed explicitly as words or through numerical
  ranges.

--

- Reliability amount (within-subjects)
  - High
  - Low

???

- Whether this reliability information indicated that NPV was reliable or not.

--

- NPV amount (within-displays)
  - Five values (400-900)

???

- Each project's NPV, which ranged between 400 and 900.
  - These values were the inverse of each project's intrinsic value, such
    that the highest NPV project had the lowest intrinsic value, and vice
    versa.
  - This meant that a participant's allocation is a proxy of their reliance
    on NPV.

---

## Design

Dependent variables

- Rank
  - 1-5
- Allocation
  - Out of 100%

???

- We asked participants to imagine that they are business executives in a large
  firm, and to rank each project and allocate a percentage of the budget.
- Each participant saw two displays: one for each reliability amount condition.

--

Sample

- Online recruitment (Prolific)
  - US citizens
  - 30+
- $N = 448$ 
  - 112 in each group

???

- We recruited US citizens that were aged 30 or over from Prolific.
  - We did this to get a more homogeneous sample that is more likely to have had
    experience in a business setting.
- We recruited 448 participants based on a power analysis, so that we'd have 112
  in each between-subjects condition.

---

## High alignment

```{r high-alignment}
include_graphics("img/high_alignment.png")
```

???

- This is an example of a high alignment project set.
- The set is made up of oil well projects.
    - They all vary on the same intrinsic features.
- Notice that the project with the most attractive "Predicted project features"
  has the lowest NPV.

---

## Low alignment

```{r low-alignment}
include_graphics("img/low_alignment.png")
```

???

- This is an example of a low alignment project set.
- Each project is from a different domain.

---


## Verbal reliability

???

- NPVs were displayed with reliability information expressed as either verbal
  prompts or ranges.

--

.pull-left[

### Low

```{r explicit-reliability-low, results='asis'}
get_reliability_explicit(836)[1] %>%
  cat()
```

]

.pull-right[

### High

```{r explicit-reliability-high, results='asis'}
get_reliability_explicit(836)[2] %>%
  cat()
```

]

???

- These are examples of NPVs in the verbal reliability condition.
- When presented as a single value, NPV is equivalent the midpoint of the
  expected range of values.

  - For verbal reliability this was done using explicit words
--

## Numerical reliability

.pull-left[

### Low (&#177;85% of midpoint)

```{r implicit-reliability-low, results='asis'}
get_reliability_implicit(836)[1] %>%
  cat()
```

]

.pull-right[

### High (&#177;5% of midpoint)

```{r implicit-reliability-high, results='asis'}
get_reliability_implicit(836)[2] %>%
  cat()
```

]

???

- These are examples of NPVs in the numerical reliability condition
- The ranges were either five or 85 percent of the NPV.
  - This manipulation was within-subjects so participants saw both of these.
  - So this is about as obvious a range difference as you could make.

---

## Hypotheses

### Verbal reliability

- NPV reliability will affect decision making

???

- We predicted that participants would use reliability information if it was
  expressed explicitly in words.

--

#### High alignment

- Positive correlation between allocation and NPV amount.

???

- Specifically, we expected them to use NPV to inform their allocations when
  they told that it is reliable...

--

#### Low alignment

- Negative correlation between allocation and NPV amount.

???

- and to use the intrinsic features when told that it is not.

--

### Numerical reliability

- No effect of alignment, reliability amount, or NPV amount.

???

- We predicted that when reliability is expressed as ranges people would
  disregard them.
  - Pilot data indicated that people sometimes do not even use the midpoint
    information.

# Results

???

- We found support for most of our hypotheses.

---

## Verbal reliability, high alignment

```{r reliability-type-explicit-alignment-high}
plot_alignment_8$reliability_type_explicit_alignment_high
```

.small[

`r results_alignment_8$two_way$reliability_type_explicit_alignment_high`

]

???

- Here is the allocation data plotted against NPV amount on the x-axis.
- A positive correlation here suggests a reliance on NPV.
- We found a significant interaction between reliability amount and NPV amount
  for the explicit reliability high alignment condition.
- Participants allocated based on NPV when told that it is reliable, but
  allocated based on the projects' intrinsic features when told that NPV is
  unreliable.
- At the bottom of the slides I'll be showing the standardised beta coefficient
  for the interaction.

---

## Verbal reliability, low alignment

```{r reliability-type-explicit-alignment-low}
plot_alignment_8$reliability_type_explicit_alignment_low
```

.small[

`r results_alignment_8$two_way$reliability_type_explicit_alignment_low`

]

???

- In the low alignment condition, participants still used the reliability
  information, as is seen by the significant interaction.

---

## Verbal reliability

```{r three-way-explicit}
plot_alignment_8$three_way$explicit
```

.small[

`r results_alignment_8$three_way$explicit`

]

???

- We also found a significant three-way interaction between NPV, reliability
  amount, and alignment.
  - This indicates that participants relied on NPV for their allocations more
    when projects were alignable, compared to when they were not.

---

## Numerical reliability, high alignment

```{r reliability-type-implicit-alignment-high}
plot_alignment_8$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_high
```

.small[

`r results_alignment_8$two_way$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_high`

]

???

- When reliability was expressed as ranges, participants relied on NPV, but
  disregarded the range information completely.

---

## Numerical reliability, low alignment

```{r reliability-type-implicit-alignment-low}
plot_alignment_8$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_low
```

.small[

`r results_alignment_8$two_way$reliability_type_implicit_alignment_low`

]

???

- We saw the same thing for the low alignment condition.

---

## Numerical reliability

```{r three-way-implicit}
plot_alignment_8$three_way$implicit
```

.small[

`r results_alignment_8$three_way$implicit`

]

???

- There was no three-way interaction, but contrary to some of our previous pilot
  data, there was a small effect of alignment when averaging over reliability amount.

# Conclusion

---

## Summary


- When projects were comparable
  - Used verbal reliability information

???

- People used explicit reliability information to inform their metric
  evaluations.

--

- When projects were not comparable
  - Relied more on NPV

???

- But relied more heavily on NPV when projects were dissimilar.

--

- People did not used numerical reliability information

???

- People did not moderate their evaluations when given numerical indicators of
  reliability.
  - But they at least used the midpoint to make their decisions.

---

## Theoretical implications

- Evidence for structural alignment in financial decision making

???

- Structural alignment effects replicate in financial decision making
  - Showing that alignable differences help make decisions in difficult
    comparisons

--

- Evidence for variance neglect

???

- Variance information is neglected when presented numerically

---

## Practical implications

- What is optimal?
  - Financial metrics vs. project features

???

- There are no specific prescriptions at the moment.
  - If we want people to use their knowledge of the specific domains to make
    judgements and not only use financial metrics, then diversification is a
    problem.
  - If we only want people to use financial metrics, then the allure of
    similarity to highlight intrinsic features is a problem.
- Either way, both our data the real-world data I showed at the beginning
  suggest that at the very least diversification has a cost that wasn't previously considered.

--

  - Variance vs. point estimate

???
- Also, do we want managers to consider the ranges of possible outcomes from forecasts?
  - Or do we only want them to use the best point estimate?
  - If paying attention to variance is valuable, then we need to develop better
    ways of supporting that kind of information.
 
---

## Next steps

- Replicate with managers

???

- This work was with lay people, but, pilot data with masters of management
  students overall showed the same kind of patterns, where they ignore numerical
  ranges.
  - So we are planning on replicating this work but with managers of real
  businesses.

--

- Decision aids

???

- We are also interested in testing various ways of reducing the variance
  neglect.
- So let us know if you're interested in similar issues.
