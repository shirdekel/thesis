Hello, my name is Shir and this is a prerecorded presentation for the 2021
Meeting of the Australasian Mathematical Psychology Conference.

# Background

---

## Imagine you're the ARC

- Picture of nanoscience project and history project

???

- How do you compare these projects? 
- One way is to use something like an H index
  - But this doesn't have the same reliability across disciplines

---

## Business context

- oil well vs refinery

???

- Diversified firms face a similar problem
- Has financial implications

---

##  NPV

- formula

???

- They deal with this problem by using metrics such as NPV
- But just like H index reliability varies across domains

---

## Project similarity bias

- Alignable differences are more important than non-alignable differences
  - More weight in judgements of similarity (Markman & Gentner, 1996)
  - Easier to list (Gentner & Gunn, 2001)
  - Used more for decision making (Markman & Medin, 1995; Markman, 2010)

???

- We know that people evaluate options differently based on how easy it is to
  compare across them

---

## Variance neglect

- People are not good at using variance information (e.g., Konold, 1989)
  - Specifically with forecasting (e.g., Vivalt, 2018)

- e.g., which forecaster would you listen to?
  - A: 14-16˚C
  - B: 15-45˚C
  
---

## Research questions

- Does project similarity affect people's evaluation of projects that have
  the same forecasts?
- Do people use reliability information to inform their evaluations?

# The current study

---

## Hypotheses

- When comparing alignable projects:
  - NPV reliability will affect decision making

- When comparing non-alignable projects:
  - NPV reliability will not affect decision making

???

- This is an example of the display participants saw.
- Each participant saw two of these: one for each reliability amount condition.

---

## High alignment

```{r high-alignment}
include_graphics("img/high_alignment.png")
```

???

- This is an example of a high alignment project set.

---

## Low alignment

```{r low-alignment}
include_graphics("img/low_alignment.png")
```

???

- This is an example of a low alignment project set.

---

## Implicit reliability

.pull-left[

### Low

```{r implicit-reliability-low, results='asis'}
get_reliability_implicit(836)[1] %>%
  cat()
```

]

.pull-right[

### High

```{r implicit-reliability-high, results='asis'}
get_reliability_implicit(836)[2] %>%
  cat()
```

]

???

- NPVs were displayed with reliability information expressed as either verbal
  prompts or ranges
- Reliability amount was manipulated by either changing the width of the ranges
  or changing the explicit wording

---

## Explicit reliability:

.pull-left[

### Low

```{r explicit-reliability-low, results='asis'}
get_reliability_explicit(836)[1] %>%
  cat()
```

]

.pull-right[

### High

```{r explicit-reliability-high, results='asis'}
get_reliability_explicit(836)[2] %>%
  cat()
```

]

???

- NPVs were displayed with reliability information expressed as either verbal
  prompts or ranges
- Reliability amount was manipulated by either changing the width of the ranges
  or changing the explicit wording

---

## Design

Independent variables

- Alignment (between-subjects)
  - Low (all from different industries)
  - High (all from the same industry)
--

- Reliability type (between-subjects)
  - Implicit (ranges)
  - Explicit (verbal)
--

- Reliability amount (within-subjects)
  - Low
  - High
--

Dependent variables

- Allocation
  - Out of 100%
- Rank
  - 1-5

## Summary

## Theoretical implications

## Practical implications

---

## Next steps

- Test middle managers
  - Qualtrics sample
  - Do they replicate these effects?

- How do we ensure people aggregate risk when projects are not alignable
