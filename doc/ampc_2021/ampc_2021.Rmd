## Aims

.pull-left[
### Limitations of the literature

1. Limited description-based repeated-play studies

2. Limited choice bracketing manipulations of description-based repeated-play gambles

3. Limited application to business decision-making context

.pull-right[
### We investigated:

1. Description-based repeated-play gambles

2. With novel risky choice bracketing manipulations

3. Using business scenarios
]

## Hypotheses

More risky choice:

- When participants know how many projects to expect than when they are unaware
- In joint presentation than in separate presentation
- When projects are alignable than non-alignable
- Interactions?

# Methods

---

## Instructions


---

## High alignment

---

## Low alignment

---

## Design

Independent variables
- Reliability type (between-subjects)
  - Implicit (ranges)
  - Explicit (verbal)
--

- Reliability amount (within-subjects)
  - Low
  - High
--

- Alignment (between-subjects)
  - Low (all from different industries)
  - High (all from the same industry)

---

## Design

Dependent variable

- Resource allocation
  - Out of 100%

## Next steps

- Test middle managers
  - Qualtrics sample
  - Do they replicate these effects?

- How do we ensure people aggregate risk when projects are not alignable
