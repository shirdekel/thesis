People make all sorts of decisions based on quantitative forecasts. However, it
is unclear how people use these kinds of metrics in the context of other,
non-numerical forms of information. Here we focus on resource allocation
scenarios in large companies, wherein managers often have to allocate resources
across very dissimilar projects (imagine a granting agency choosing between a
proposal from biology or sociology). They use financial measures that simplify
this difficult comparison because they aim to be equally applicable to any kind
of project, but across domains, these measures vary in their reliability. Here
we investigate the effects of project similarity, and information about variance
in the forecasts. We found that participants accommodate their use of financial
forecasts based on its reliability when allocating resources to a set of similar
projects, but use reliability information less when allocating to a set of less
similar projects. However, they only considered reliability when it was verbally
communicated, not when it was expressed numerically. When expressed numerically,
people made no use of the information about the variance in the forecasts.
These findings show how the use of quantitative forecasts changes based on
non-numerical information, despite the motivation of developing those metrics to
apply across semantic contexts. In addition, people tend to ignore the
quantified variance information in their forecasts.
