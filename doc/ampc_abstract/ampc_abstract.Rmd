Business executives often have to allocate resources across very dissimilar
projects. They use financial measures, such as Net Present Value (NPV), that
simplify this difficult comparison because they aim to be equally applicable to
any kind of project, but these measures vary in their reliability. Psychological
research suggests that comparing alignable objects (apples to apples) will be
easier than comparing non-alignable objects [apples to oranges; e.g.,
@markman1993; @markman1995]. Our previous experiments showed that naive
participants accommodate their use of a financial measure (NPV) based on its
reliability when allocating resources to a set of alignable projects, but use it
regardless of reliability when allocating to a set of non-alignable projects.
Further, participants with more business experience similarly rely more on NPV
for non-alignable projects. However, they do not use information about the
variance underlying NPV. The present experiment replicated these findings with
better controls for business experience and presentation style, which were
potentially confounding factors in previous experiments. These findings support
the importance of the structural alignment in decision-making and suggests that
people do not use variance information in their financial decisions.
