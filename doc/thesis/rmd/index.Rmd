(ref:abstract) The thesis is about decision-making in business settings and how
people deal with situations in which they have both semantically and
statistically relevant information. The overarching thesis is that people are
often influenced by largely semantic information despite the availability of
useful statistical information. There were three main research questions,
corresponding to the three body chapters. The first research question asks how
option similarity and variance information affect people's resource allocation
behaviour. I found that when options are similar, people are able to selectively
respond to reliability information about given data. However, when options are
not similar people have to rely on easily comparable data, regardless of its
reliability. Further, people struggle to use variance information to ascertain
reliability information, regardless of business experience. The second research
question asks how choice grouping affects people's risky choice. We found that
people accept more risky choices when they anticipate those choices, and when
they see them together rather than separately. Choice similarity strengthens
this presentation effect. The third research question asks how anecdotes, and
their similarity to the problem at hand, affect business decisions. We found
anecdote similarity strengthens the effect of anecdotes, and that even explicit
hints do not reduce the anecdote effect. These results have implications both
for how people make decisions, and how managers in large organisations may be
biased when making important decisions.
