### Discussion {#discussion-aggregation-1}

I found evidence for most of the Experiment 1 hypotheses. Specifically, I found
that people make more risky choices when considering those choices jointly on
the same page, compared to on separate pages; and when they knew how many
choices were in the set. Further, I found an interaction between project
similarity and presentation, and found tentative evidence that people are less
risk averse when risky choices are aggregated for them.

These results add evidence to the choice bracketing account, showing that people
tend to consider their options one at a time. Further, they suggest that people
are using a sort of "naive" aggregation process when they are encouraged to
group their choices together. Specifically, the higher rates of choice for
participants that viewed all ten projects jointly suggests that they were
encouraged by the joint display to consider the set of projects together, and
perhaps conclude that ultimately investing in a higher number of gambles is
potentially valuable due to the possibility that one project might pay off the
projects that showed losses. Similarly, it is likely that having an awareness of
the total number of projects in the set would increase the likelihood that
participants would use this sort of "naive" aggregation.

However, the similarity \\times presentation interaction is harder to explain
since I did not originally hypothesise it. In fact, the results seem to suggest
the opposite to what was originally expected. Specifically, the interaction
seems to be driven by the separate high similarity condition being lower, rather
than by the joint high similarity being higher. This is surprising, since we
hypothesised that those in the high similarity condition would be be less risk
averse, due to the better ability to consider the isolated projects as a set.
However, a more likely explanation is that participants may be engaging in a
naive *diverification*, rather. That is, participants may be considering the
high similarity condition as a sign that the set of projects may not be
sufficiently "diversified". However, this explanation would also predict the
joint presentation condition to be lower in the high similarity condition. So,
it might be the case that those in the separate condition were constantly
thinking that they might be getting a different project in the next display, so
rejected more projects because of the lack of diversification, but not realising
that they would not be getting any other type of project. Those in the joint
presentation, on the other hand, were able to see all ten projects, so would
already known that there were no other projects in the set, and so were less
likely to reject projects on the basis of the hope for different projects in the
future.

This experiment had two major limitations. First, proper counterbalancing was
not used in either project domains, nor in the order of the within-subjects
manipulation of presentation. As such, it is unclear what role these elements
played in the results. Second, as mentioned
[above](#outcome-distribution-aggregation-3), there was a mistake in the
generation of the gamble values that meant that the individual gambles did not
correspond with the distribution that participants saw. Experiment 2 addressed
both these issues.
