Experiment 4 investigated the effect of "awareness" on project choice. The
"naive" condition attempted to encourage participants to focus on projects one
at a time and did not say how many projects there were. The "aware" condition
attempted to encourage participants to think of all 20 projects (by saying the
total number in the beginning, and notifying participants where they were in the
project order).
