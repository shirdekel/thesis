Experiment 2 investigated the effect of presentation, awareness, and
distribution on project choice. Here I addressed the two main limitations of
Experiment 1 detailed [above](#discussion-aggregation-1) by counterbalancing
project domain and manipulating the main variables between-subjects. By
counterbalancing domains, any effects we find cannot be attributed to the type
of project that participants saw, and by manipulating presentation
between-subjects, I take out the potentially confounding factor of reduced risk
aversion over time, or after seeing the same gamble values.
