A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes.

A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 11 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 120. Further, the number of positive reviews the restaurant received needed to be at least 48 a month.

A decentralised organisational structure meant that the individual teams had greater autonomy to complete their tasks, increasing the efficiency of important project stages. Being horizontally integrated meant that the project can be easily marketed to the customer base of the other business units in the company. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 3200 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 57%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 71%. Further, the chip has a relatively low power consumption due to it operating Reduced Instruction Set Computing, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Microxy</li><li>Location: Montreal, Canada</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: microchip</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Microchips produced: 4800 an hour</li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 63%</li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 79%</li><li>Type of chip architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Computing</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Altchip"],["microchip"],["Toronto, Canada"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Microchips produced: 4000 an hour<\/li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 60%<\/li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 75%<\/li><li>Type of chip architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Computing<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Altchip_microchip_105_90_Microchips-produced_4000_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_60_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_75_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Altchip_microchip_105_90_Microchips-produced_4000_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_60_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_75_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Altchip_microchip_105_90_Microchips-produced_4000_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_60_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_75_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["105"]],[["Solgistics"],["shipping logistics"],["Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Packages shipped: 800 a week<\/li><li>Number of orders that do not spend time in a bottleneck: 400 a day<\/li><li>Average accuracy of shipments: 90%<\/li><li>Shipping type: parcel<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Solgistics_shipping-logistics_905_93_Packages-shipped_800_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_400_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_90_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Solgistics_shipping-logistics_905_93_Packages-shipped_800_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_400_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_90_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Solgistics_shipping-logistics_905_93_Packages-shipped_800_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_400_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_90_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["93"],["905"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that key operational decisions were delayed with what needed to be a timely process.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 9 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 100. Further, the number of positive reviews the restaurant received needed to be at least 40 a month.

Being horizontally integrated meant that the project can be easily marketed to the customer base of the other business units in the company.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 9 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 100. Further, the number of positive reviews the restaurant received needed to be at least 40 a month. Further, the restaurant did not have many offerings for the recent health trend due to it operating fast food, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Savoro</li><li>Location: Milan, Italy</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: restaurant chain</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Restaurants established: 9 a year</li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 100</li><li>Positive reviews: 40 a month</li><li>Restaurant type: fast food</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Dinerly"],["restaurant chain"],["Rome, Italy"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Restaurants established: 7 a year<\/li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 80<\/li><li>Positive reviews: 32 a month<\/li><li>Restaurant type: fast food<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_903_93_Restaurants-established_7_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_80_Positive-reviews_32_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_903_93_Restaurants-established_7_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_80_Positive-reviews_32_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_903_93_Restaurants-established_7_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_80_Positive-reviews_32_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["93"],["903"]],[["Vital Records"],["record label"],["Stokholm, Sweden"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Record projects completed: 6 a year<\/li><li>Radio listenership nationally: 2 million<\/li><li>Relevant network connections: 10<\/li><li>Genre: rock<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Vital-Records_record-label_102_86_Record-projects-completed_6_Radio-listenership-nationally_2_Relevant-network-connections_10_Genre_rock_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Vital-Records_record-label_102_86_Record-projects-completed_6_Radio-listenership-nationally_2_Relevant-network-connections_10_Genre_rock_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Vital-Records_record-label_102_86_Record-projects-completed_6_Radio-listenership-nationally_2_Relevant-network-connections_10_Genre_rock_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["86"],["102"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 2 million. Further, the problems in the application were relatively clear from user feedback so were quick to solve due to it being for enterprise, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Cweb</li><li>Location: California, USA</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: software</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Code written: 1200 lines a day</li><li>Security rating: 102%</li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 4 million</li><li>Target users: enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Codeck"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 85%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Codeck_software_102_90_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Codeck_software_102_90_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Codeck_software_102_90_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Enfuel"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 2000L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 7 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 80%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Enfuel_oil-well_905_92_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Enfuel_oil-well_905_92_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Enfuel_oil-well_905_92_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that poor performers took longer to be replaced, so some tasks needed considerable revision. Being vertically integrated meant that the project was reliant on in-house manufacturing and so was slow to adopt the newest technologies used by competitors. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the newspapers needed to be printed at a rate of at least 40000 a day and the number of weekly advertisers needed to be at least 64. Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 4000L a day. Further, the paper incurred heavy costs for marketing due to the reliance on advertising, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Pressbloom</li><li>Location: Mexico City, Mexico</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: national newspaper</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 30000 a day</li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 48</li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 3000L a day</li><li>Payment model: advertising</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Grown Media"],["national newspaper"],["Sydney, Australia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 50000 a day<\/li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 80<\/li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 5000L a day<\/li><li>Payment model: subscription<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_subscription_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_subscription_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_subscription_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Healthgenic"],["pharmaceutical"],["St Petersburg, Russia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Pills pressed: 300000 an hour<\/li><li>Shelf life: 20 months<\/li><li>Probability of symptom reduction after a week: 90%<\/li><li>Drug type: prescription-only<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_prescription-only_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_prescription-only_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_prescription-only_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 11 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 120. Further, the number of positive reviews the restaurant received needed to be at least 48 a month.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 4000 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 60%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 75%.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the developers needed to write at least 1000 lines a day and the the application needed to be certified with a security rating of at least 85%. Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 3 million.

Further, the restaurant had many offerings for the recent health trend due to it operating casual sit-down dining, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Savoro</li><li>Location: Lagos, Nigera</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: restaurant chain</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Restaurants established: 9 a year</li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 100</li><li>Positive reviews: 40 a month</li><li>Restaurant type: casual sit-down dining</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Dinerly"],["restaurant chain"],["Rome, Italy"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Restaurants established: 13 a year<\/li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 140<\/li><li>Positive reviews: 56 a month<\/li><li>Restaurant type: fast food<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_100_88_Restaurants-established_13_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_140_Positive-reviews_56_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_100_88_Restaurants-established_13_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_140_Positive-reviews_56_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_100_88_Restaurants-established_13_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_140_Positive-reviews_56_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Vital Records"],["record label"],["Stokholm, Sweden"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Record projects completed: 11 a year<\/li><li>Radio listenership nationally: 3 million<\/li><li>Relevant network connections: 18<\/li><li>Genre: rock<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Vital-Records_record-label_904_94_Record-projects-completed_11_Radio-listenership-nationally_3_Relevant-network-connections_18_Genre_rock_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Vital-Records_record-label_904_94_Record-projects-completed_11_Radio-listenership-nationally_3_Relevant-network-connections_18_Genre_rock_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Vital-Records_record-label_904_94_Record-projects-completed_11_Radio-listenership-nationally_3_Relevant-network-connections_18_Genre_rock_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that key operational decisions were delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being vertically integrated meant that the project was reliant on in-house manufacturing and so was slow to adopt the newest technologies used by competitors. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 4000 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 60%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 75%.

A centralised organisational structure meant that there was greater consistency across the individual teams' goals, increasing the efficiency of important project stages. Being vertically integrated meant that there was less reliance on other (under-performing) suppliers that competitors had to use. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the developers needed to write at least 1000 lines a day and the the application needed to be certified with a security rating of at least 85%. Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 3 million. Further, the problems in the application were relatively clear from user feedback so were quick to solve due to it being for enterprise, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Codeck</li><li>Location: California, USA</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: software</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day</li><li>Security rating: 85%</li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million</li><li>Target users: enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Cweb"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 1200 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 102%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 4 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Cweb_software_100_90_Code-written_1200_Security-rating_102_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_4_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Cweb_software_100_90_Code-written_1200_Security-rating_102_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_4_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Cweb_software_100_90_Code-written_1200_Security-rating_102_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_4_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["100"]],[["Refinera"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 2400L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 8 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 84%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Refinera_oil-well_901_91_Oil-extracted_2400_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_8_Probability-of-finding-oil_84_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Refinera_oil-well_901_91_Oil-extracted_2400_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_8_Probability-of-finding-oil_84_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Refinera_oil-well_901_91_Oil-extracted_2400_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_8_Probability-of-finding-oil_84_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["91"],["901"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the developers needed to write at least 1200 lines a day and the the application needed to be certified with a security rating of at least 102%. Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 4 million. Further, the problems in the application were slow to solve because of the lack of large-scale quantitative data due to it being for enterprise, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Cweb</li><li>Location: California, USA</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: software</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Code written: 800 lines a day</li><li>Security rating: 68%</li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 2 million</li><li>Target users: enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Codeck"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 85%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Codeck_software_905_92_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Codeck_software_905_92_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Codeck_software_905_92_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Enfuel"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 2000L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 7 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 80%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Enfuel_oil-well_102_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Enfuel_oil-well_102_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Enfuel_oil-well_102_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that poor performers took longer to be replaced, so some tasks needed considerable revision. Being vertically integrated meant that the project was reliant on in-house manufacturing and so was slow to adopt the newest technologies used by competitors. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 3200 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 57%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 71%. Further, the chip has less current software support due to it operating Reduced Instruction Set Computing, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Microxy</li><li>Location: Abu Dhabi, UAE</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: microchip</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Microchips produced: 2400 an hour</li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 54%</li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 68%</li><li>Type of chip architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Computing</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Altchip"],["microchip"],["Toronto, Canada"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Microchips produced: 4000 an hour<\/li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 60%<\/li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 75%<\/li><li>Type of chip architecture: Complex Instruction Set Computing<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Altchip_microchip_902_94_Microchips-produced_4000_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_60_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_75_Type-of-chip-architecture_Complex Instruction Set Computing_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Altchip_microchip_902_94_Microchips-produced_4000_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_60_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_75_Type-of-chip-architecture_Complex Instruction Set Computing_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Altchip_microchip_902_94_Microchips-produced_4000_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_60_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_75_Type-of-chip-architecture_Complex Instruction Set Computing_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Solgistics"],["shipping logistics"],["Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Packages shipped: 800 a week<\/li><li>Number of orders that do not spend time in a bottleneck: 400 a day<\/li><li>Average accuracy of shipments: 90%<\/li><li>Shipping type: freight<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Solgistics_shipping-logistics_103_87_Packages-shipped_800_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_400_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_90_Shipping-type_freight_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Solgistics_shipping-logistics_103_87_Packages-shipped_800_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_400_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_90_Shipping-type_freight_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Solgistics_shipping-logistics_103_87_Packages-shipped_800_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_400_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_90_Shipping-type_freight_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the developers needed to write at least 1200 lines a day and the the application needed to be certified with a security rating of at least 102%. Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 4 million. Further, the problems in the application were slow to solve because of the lack of large-scale quantitative data due to it being for enterprise, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Cweb</li><li>Location: California, USA</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: software</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Code written: 800 lines a day</li><li>Security rating: 68%</li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 2 million</li><li>Target users: enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Codeck"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 85%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Codeck_software_901_91_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Codeck_software_901_91_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Codeck_software_901_91_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["91"],["901"]],[["Enfuel"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 2000L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 7 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 80%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Enfuel_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Enfuel_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Enfuel_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["100"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the newspapers needed to be printed at a rate of at least 60000 a day and the number of weekly advertisers needed to be at least 96. Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 6000L a day. Further, the paper incurred a surge of casual visitors due to the reliance on advertising, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Pressbloom</li><li>Location: Mexico City, Mexico</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: national newspaper</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 70000 a day</li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 112</li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 7000L a day</li><li>Payment model: advertising</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Grown Media"],["national newspaper"],["Sydney, Australia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 50000 a day<\/li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 80<\/li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 5000L a day<\/li><li>Payment model: subscription<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_102_90_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_subscription_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_102_90_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_subscription_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_102_90_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_subscription_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["102"]],[["Healthgenic"],["pharmaceutical"],["St Petersburg, Russia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Pills pressed: 300000 an hour<\/li><li>Shelf life: 20 months<\/li><li>Probability of symptom reduction after a week: 90%<\/li><li>Drug type: prescription-only<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_904_95_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_prescription-only_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_904_95_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_prescription-only_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_904_95_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_prescription-only_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["95"],["904"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that the teams' project timelines were not coordinated perfectly, so some tasks needed considerable revision.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 4000 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 60%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 75%.

A centralised organisational structure meant that key operational decisions were delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being vertically integrated meant that the project was reliant on in-house manufacturing and so was slow to adopt the newest technologies used by competitors. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the developers needed to write at least 1000 lines a day and the the application needed to be certified with a security rating of at least 85%. Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 3 million. Further, the problems in the application were slow to solve because of the lack of large-scale quantitative data due to it being for enterprise, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Codeck</li><li>Location: California, USA</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: software</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day</li><li>Security rating: 85%</li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million</li><li>Target users: enterprise</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Cweb"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 800 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 68%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 2 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Cweb_software_901_91_Code-written_800_Security-rating_68_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_2_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Cweb_software_901_91_Code-written_800_Security-rating_68_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_2_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Cweb_software_901_91_Code-written_800_Security-rating_68_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_2_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["91"],["901"]],[["Refinera"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 1600L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 6 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 76%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refinera_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_1600_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_6_Probability-of-finding-oil_76_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refinera_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_1600_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_6_Probability-of-finding-oil_76_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refinera_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_1600_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_6_Probability-of-finding-oil_76_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["100"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that the teams' project timelines were not coordinated perfectly, so some tasks needed considerable revision. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 4000 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 60%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 75%. Further, the chip has a higher power consumption due to it operating Complex Instruction Set Computing, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Altchip</li><li>Location: Abu Dhabi, UAE</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: microchip</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Microchips produced: 4000 an hour</li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 60%</li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 75%</li><li>Type of chip architecture: Complex Instruction Set Computing</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Microxy"],["microchip"],["Toronto, Canada"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Microchips produced: 2400 an hour<\/li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 54%<\/li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 68%<\/li><li>Type of chip architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Computing<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Microxy_microchip_905_93_Microchips-produced_2400_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_54_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_68_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Microxy_microchip_905_93_Microchips-produced_2400_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_54_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_68_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Microxy_microchip_905_93_Microchips-produced_2400_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_54_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_68_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["93"],["905"]],[["Logivia"],["shipping logistics"],["Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Packages shipped: 480 a week<\/li><li>Number of orders that do not spend time in a bottleneck: 240 a day<\/li><li>Average accuracy of shipments: 81%<\/li><li>Shipping type: parcel<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Logivia_shipping-logistics_105_90_Packages-shipped_480_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_240_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_81_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Logivia_shipping-logistics_105_90_Packages-shipped_480_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_240_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_81_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Logivia_shipping-logistics_105_90_Packages-shipped_480_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_240_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_81_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["105"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the railway lines needed to be built at a rate of at least 6 a decade and the number of paying customers at peak hour needed to be at least 2400. Further, the carriages needed to be have been estimated to last in good shape for at least 14 years. Further, the railway was difficult to construct among other city activity due to it operating intracity, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Railmont</li><li>Location: Daqing, China</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: railway</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Railway lines built: 4 a decade</li><li>Number of seats filled by paying customers at peak hour: 1600</li><li>Time before the train carriages will need to be serviced: 10 years</li><li>Operation type: intracity</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Rural Pass"],["railway"],["Guangzhou, China"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Railway lines built: 5 a decade<\/li><li>Number of seats filled by paying customers at peak hour: 2000<\/li><li>Time before the train carriages will need to be serviced: 12 years<\/li><li>Operation type: intracity<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Rural-Pass_railway_902_94_Railway-lines-built_5_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_2000_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_12_Operation-type_intracity_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Rural-Pass_railway_902_94_Railway-lines-built_5_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_2000_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_12_Operation-type_intracity_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Rural-Pass_railway_902_94_Railway-lines-built_5_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_2000_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_12_Operation-type_intracity_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Refit"],["high-rise construction"],["London, UK"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>High-rises built: 8 a year<\/li><li>Probability that the builders complete construction within a month of the due date: 70%<\/li><li>Number of tenant expressions of interest: 100<\/li><li>Primary use: mixed office-retail<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refit_high-rise-construction_104_89_High-rises-built_8_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_70_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_100_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refit_high-rise-construction_104_89_High-rises-built_8_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_70_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_100_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refit_high-rise-construction_104_89_High-rises-built_8_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_70_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_100_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the railway lines needed to be built at a rate of at least 6 a decade and the number of paying customers at peak hour needed to be at least 2400. Further, the carriages needed to be have been estimated to last in good shape for at least 14 years. Further, the railway was difficult to construct among other city activity due to it operating intracity, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Railmont</li><li>Location: Daqing, China</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: railway</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Railway lines built: 4 a decade</li><li>Number of seats filled by paying customers at peak hour: 1600</li><li>Time before the train carriages will need to be serviced: 10 years</li><li>Operation type: intracity</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Rural Pass"],["railway"],["Guangzhou, China"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Railway lines built: 5 a decade<\/li><li>Number of seats filled by paying customers at peak hour: 2000<\/li><li>Time before the train carriages will need to be serviced: 12 years<\/li><li>Operation type: intracity<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Rural-Pass_railway_900_95_Railway-lines-built_5_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_2000_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_12_Operation-type_intracity_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Rural-Pass_railway_900_95_Railway-lines-built_5_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_2000_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_12_Operation-type_intracity_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Rural-Pass_railway_900_95_Railway-lines-built_5_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_2000_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_12_Operation-type_intracity_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["95"],["900"]],[["Refit"],["high-rise construction"],["London, UK"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>High-rises built: 8 a year<\/li><li>Probability that the builders complete construction within a month of the due date: 70%<\/li><li>Number of tenant expressions of interest: 100<\/li><li>Primary use: mixed office-retail<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refit_high-rise-construction_102_87_High-rises-built_8_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_70_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_100_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refit_high-rise-construction_102_87_High-rises-built_8_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_70_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_100_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Refit_high-rise-construction_102_87_High-rises-built_8_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_70_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_100_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["87"],["102"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that the individual teams had greater autonomy to complete their tasks, increasing the efficiency of important project stages. Being horizontally integrated meant that the project can be easily marketed to the customer base of the other business units in the company. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the newspapers needed to be printed at a rate of at least 40000 a day and the number of weekly advertisers needed to be at least 64. Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 4000L a day. Further, the paper incurred a surge of casual visitors due to the reliance on advertising, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Pressbloom</li><li>Location: Wellington, New Zealand</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: national newspaper</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 60000 a day</li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 96</li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 6000L a day</li><li>Payment model: advertising</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Grown Media"],["national newspaper"],["Sydney, Australia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 50000 a day<\/li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 80<\/li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 5000L a day<\/li><li>Payment model: advertising<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_102_90_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_advertising_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_102_90_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_102_90_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["102"]],[["Healthgenic"],["pharmaceutical"],["St Petersburg, Russia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Pills pressed: 300000 an hour<\/li><li>Shelf life: 20 months<\/li><li>Probability of symptom reduction after a week: 90%<\/li><li>Drug type: over-the-counter<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_904_95_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_904_95_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_904_95_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["95"],["904"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 7 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 80.

A centralised organisational structure meant that key operational decisions were delayed with what needed to be a timely process.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the railway lines needed to be built at a rate of at least 5 a decade and the number of paying customers at peak hour needed to be at least 2000. Further, the carriages needed to be have been estimated to last in good shape for at least 12 years. Further, the railway was difficult to construct among other city activity due to it operating intracity, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Rural Pass</li><li>Location: Daqing, China</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: railway</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Railway lines built: 5 a decade</li><li>Number of seats filled by paying customers at peak hour: 2000</li><li>Time before the train carriages will need to be serviced: 12 years</li><li>Operation type: intracity</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Railmont"],["railway"],["Guangzhou, China"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Railway lines built: 4 a decade<\/li><li>Number of seats filled by paying customers at peak hour: 1600<\/li><li>Time before the train carriages will need to be serviced: 10 years<\/li><li>Operation type: intracity<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Railmont_railway_902_94_Railway-lines-built_4_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_1600_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_10_Operation-type_intracity_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Railmont_railway_902_94_Railway-lines-built_4_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_1600_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_10_Operation-type_intracity_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Railmont_railway_902_94_Railway-lines-built_4_Number-of-seats-filled-by-paying-customers-at-peak-hour_1600_Time-before-the-train-carriages-will-need-to-be-serviced_10_Operation-type_intracity_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Erectic"],["high-rise construction"],["London, UK"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>High-rises built: 6 a year<\/li><li>Probability that the builders complete construction within a month of the due date: 66%<\/li><li>Number of tenant expressions of interest: 80<\/li><li>Primary use: mixed office-retail<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Erectic_high-rise-construction_104_89_High-rises-built_6_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_66_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_80_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Erectic_high-rise-construction_104_89_High-rises-built_6_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_66_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_80_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Erectic_high-rise-construction_104_89_High-rises-built_6_Probability-that-the-builders-complete-construction-within-a-month-of-the-due-date_66_Number-of-tenant-expressions-of-interest_80_Primary-use_mixed office-retail_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that the teams' project timelines were not coordinated perfectly, so some tasks needed considerable revision. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 9 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 100. Further, the number of positive reviews the restaurant received needed to be at least 40 a month. Further, the restaurant had to source a relatively large amount of fresh ingredients due to it operating casual sit-down dining, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Savoro</li><li>Location: Lagos, Nigera</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: restaurant chain</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Restaurants established: 9 a year</li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 100</li><li>Positive reviews: 40 a month</li><li>Restaurant type: casual sit-down dining</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Dinerly"],["restaurant chain"],["Rome, Italy"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Restaurants established: 5 a year<\/li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 60<\/li><li>Positive reviews: 24 a month<\/li><li>Restaurant type: fast food<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_904_94_Restaurants-established_5_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_60_Positive-reviews_24_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_904_94_Restaurants-established_5_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_60_Positive-reviews_24_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_904_94_Restaurants-established_5_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_60_Positive-reviews_24_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Vital Records"],["record label"],["Stokholm, Sweden"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Record projects completed: 5 a year<\/li><li>Radio listenership nationally: 1 million<\/li><li>Relevant network connections: 8<\/li><li>Genre: rock<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_negative_Vital-Records_record-label_100_88_Record-projects-completed_5_Radio-listenership-nationally_1_Relevant-network-connections_8_Genre_rock_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_negative_Vital-Records_record-label_100_88_Record-projects-completed_5_Radio-listenership-nationally_1_Relevant-network-connections_8_Genre_rock_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_negative_Vital-Records_record-label_100_88_Record-projects-completed_5_Radio-listenership-nationally_1_Relevant-network-connections_8_Genre_rock_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that employees had a greater sense of initiative, so were able to take care of important challenges early. Being horizontally integrated meant that the project can be easily marketed to the customer base of the other business units in the company. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the developers needed to write at least 1000 lines a day and the the application needed to be certified with a security rating of at least 85%. Further, the number of potential first-year customers needed to be at least 3 million. Further, the problems in the application were quick to solve because of the availability of quantitative data due to it being for ordinary consumers, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Codeck</li><li>Location: Mumbai, India</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: software</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day</li><li>Security rating: 85%</li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million</li><li>Target users: ordinary consumers</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Cweb"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 1400 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 119%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 4 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Cweb_software_102_90_Code-written_1400_Security-rating_119_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_4_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Cweb_software_102_90_Code-written_1400_Security-rating_119_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_4_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Cweb_software_102_90_Code-written_1400_Security-rating_119_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_4_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Refinera"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 2800L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 10 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 88%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Refinera_oil-well_905_92_Oil-extracted_2800_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_10_Probability-of-finding-oil_88_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Refinera_oil-well_905_92_Oil-extracted_2800_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_10_Probability-of-finding-oil_88_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Refinera_oil-well_905_92_Oil-extracted_2800_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_10_Probability-of-finding-oil_88_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A decentralised organisational structure meant that communication across relevant business units was delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being horizontally integrated meant that there was a greater regulatory scrutiny on the project, which slowed down some relevant processes. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the newspapers needed to be printed at a rate of at least 60000 a day and the number of weekly advertisers needed to be at least 96. Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 6000L a day. Further, the paper incurred heavy costs for marketing due to the reliance on advertising, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Pressbloom</li><li>Location: Wellington, New Zealand</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: national newspaper</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 40000 a day</li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 64</li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 4000L a day</li><li>Payment model: advertising</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Grown Media"],["national newspaper"],["Sydney, Australia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 50000 a day<\/li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 80<\/li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 5000L a day<\/li><li>Payment model: advertising<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_advertising_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Grown-Media_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_50000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_80_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_5000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Healthgenic"],["pharmaceutical"],["St Petersburg, Russia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Pills pressed: 300000 an hour<\/li><li>Shelf life: 20 months<\/li><li>Probability of symptom reduction after a week: 90%<\/li><li>Drug type: over-the-counter<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Healthgenic_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_300000_Shelf-life_20_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_90_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that poor performers took longer to be replaced, so some tasks needed considerable revision.

A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the railway lines needed to be built at a rate of at least 4 a decade and the number of paying customers at peak hour needed to be at least 1600. Further, the carriages needed to be have been estimated to last in good shape for at least 10 years.

Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 6000L a day.

A centralised organisational structure meant that employees had a clearer chain of command, so were able to take care of important challenges early. Being vertically integrated meant that there was less reliance on other (under-performing) suppliers that competitors had to use. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the microchips needed to be produced at a rate of at least 4800 an hour and the semiconductor yield needed to be at least 63%. Further, the percent of compatible devices needed to be at least 79%.

A centralised organisational structure meant that key operational decisions were delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being vertically integrated meant that the project was reliant on in-house manufacturing and so was slow to adopt the newest technologies used by competitors. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the newspapers needed to be printed at a rate of at least 50000 a day and the number of weekly advertisers needed to be at least 80. Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 5000L a day. Further, the paper incurred heavy costs for marketing due to the reliance on advertising, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Grown Media</li><li>Location: Wellington, New Zealand</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: national newspaper</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 50000 a day</li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 80</li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 5000L a day</li><li>Payment model: advertising</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Pressbloom"],["national newspaper"],["Sydney, Australia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 40000 a day<\/li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 64<\/li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 4000L a day<\/li><li>Payment model: advertising<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pressbloom_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_40000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_64_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_4000_Payment-model_advertising_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pressbloom_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_40000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_64_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_4000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pressbloom_national-newspaper_903_93_Newspapers-printed_40000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_64_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_4000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Pharmacore"],["pharmaceutical"],["St Petersburg, Russia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Pills pressed: 240000 an hour<\/li><li>Shelf life: 16 months<\/li><li>Probability of symptom reduction after a week: 86%<\/li><li>Drug type: over-the-counter<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pharmacore_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_240000_Shelf-life_16_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_86_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pharmacore_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_240000_Shelf-life_16_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_86_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pharmacore_pharmaceutical_104_88_Pills-pressed_240000_Shelf-life_16_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_86_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

Further, the chip optimised for most current software due to it operating Complex Instruction Set Computing, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Altchip</li><li>Location: Abu Dhabi, UAE</li><li>Integration: horizontal</li><li>Structure: decentralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: microchip</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Microchips produced: 4000 an hour</li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 60%</li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 75%</li><li>Type of chip architecture: Complex Instruction Set Computing</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Microxy"],["microchip"],["Toronto, Canada"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Microchips produced: 5600 an hour<\/li><li>Usable semiconductor yield after testing: 66%<\/li><li>Compatible devices in the market: 82%<\/li><li>Type of chip architecture: Reduced Instruction Set Computing<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Microxy_microchip_103_87_Microchips-produced_5600_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_66_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_82_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Microxy_microchip_103_87_Microchips-produced_5600_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_66_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_82_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Microxy_microchip_103_87_Microchips-produced_5600_Usable-semiconductor-yield-after-testing_66_Compatible-devices-in-the-market_82_Type-of-chip-architecture_Reduced Instruction Set Computing_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]],[["Logivia"],["shipping logistics"],["Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Packages shipped: 1120 a week<\/li><li>Number of orders that do not spend time in a bottleneck: 560 a day<\/li><li>Average accuracy of shipments: 99%<\/li><li>Shipping type: parcel<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_low_positive_Logivia_shipping-logistics_902_94_Packages-shipped_1120_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_560_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_99_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_low_positive_Logivia_shipping-logistics_902_94_Packages-shipped_1120_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_560_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_99_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_low_positive_Logivia_shipping-logistics_902_94_Packages-shipped_1120_Number-of-orders-that-do-not-spend-time-in-a-bottleneck_560_Average-accuracy-of-shipments_99_Shipping-type_parcel_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that key operational decisions were delayed with what needed to be a timely process. Being vertically integrated meant that the project was reliant on in-house manufacturing and so was slow to adopt the newest technologies used by competitors. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to make up for these issues, the newspapers needed to be printed at a rate of at least 50000 a day and the number of weekly advertisers needed to be at least 80. Further, the amount of undiscarded ink needed to be at least 5000L a day. Further, the paper incurred heavy costs for marketing due to the reliance on advertising, and so added additional financial setbacks over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Grown Media</li><li>Location: Wellington, New Zealand</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: national newspaper</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 50000 a day</li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 80</li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 5000L a day</li><li>Payment model: advertising</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Pressbloom"],["national newspaper"],["Sydney, Australia"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Newspapers printed: 40000 a day<\/li><li>Number of weekly advertisers: 64<\/li><li>Ink that is not discarded due to impurities: 4000L a day<\/li><li>Payment model: advertising<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pressbloom_national-newspaper_904_95_Newspapers-printed_40000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_64_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_4000_Payment-model_advertising_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pressbloom_national-newspaper_904_95_Newspapers-printed_40000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_64_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_4000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pressbloom_national-newspaper_904_95_Newspapers-printed_40000_Number-of-weekly-advertisers_64_Ink-that-is-not-discarded-due-to-impurities_4000_Payment-model_advertising_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["95"],["904"]],[["Pharmacore"],["pharmaceutical"],["St Petersburg, Russia"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Pills pressed: 240000 an hour<\/li><li>Shelf life: 16 months<\/li><li>Probability of symptom reduction after a week: 86%<\/li><li>Drug type: over-the-counter<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pharmacore_pharmaceutical_102_90_Pills-pressed_240000_Shelf-life_16_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_86_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pharmacore_pharmaceutical_102_90_Pills-pressed_240000_Shelf-life_16_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_86_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_negative_Pharmacore_pharmaceutical_102_90_Pills-pressed_240000_Shelf-life_16_Probability-of-symptom-reduction-after-a-week_86_Drug-type_over-the-counter_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["102"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

A centralised organisational structure meant that there was greater consistency across the individual teams' goals, increasing the efficiency of important project stages. Being vertically integrated meant that there was less reliance on other (under-performing) suppliers that competitors had to use. A post hoc analysis concluded that, to take advantage of these benefits, the restaurants needed to be established at a rate of at least 9 a year and the number of Saturday night reservations needed to be at least 100. Further, the number of positive reviews the restaurant received needed to be at least 40 a month. Further, the restaurant had to source only relatively cheap ingredients due to it operating fast food, and so added additional financial resilience over the course of the project.<ul><li>Business details:<ul><li>Business name: Savoro</li><li>Location: Milan, Italy</li><li>Integration: vertical</li><li>Structure: centralised</li></ul></li><li>Investment: restaurant chain</li><li>Predicted project features:<ul><li>Restaurants established: 9 a year</li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 100</li><li>Positive reviews: 40 a month</li><li>Restaurant type: fast food</li></ul></li></ul><legend>Case study</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Dinerly"],["restaurant chain"],["Rome, Italy"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Restaurants established: 11 a year<\/li><li>Number of reservations on a Saturday night: 120<\/li><li>Positive reviews: 48 a month<\/li><li>Restaurant type: fast food<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_102_86_Restaurants-established_11_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_120_Positive-reviews_48_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_102_86_Restaurants-established_11_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_120_Positive-reviews_48_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Dinerly_restaurant-chain_102_86_Restaurants-established_11_Number-of-reservations-on-a-Saturday-night_120_Positive-reviews_48_Restaurant-type_fast food_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["86"],["102"]],[["Vital Records"],["record label"],["Stokholm, Sweden"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Record projects completed: 10 a year<\/li><li>Radio listenership nationally: 2 million<\/li><li>Relevant network connections: 16<\/li><li>Genre: rock<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"anecdote_high_positive_Vital-Records_record-label_903_93_Record-projects-completed_10_Radio-listenership-nationally_2_Relevant-network-connections_16_Genre_rock_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"anecdote_high_positive_Vital-Records_record-label_903_93_Record-projects-completed_10_Radio-listenership-nationally_2_Relevant-network-connections_16_Genre_rock_comparison\" name=\"anecdote_high_positive_Vital-Records_record-label_903_93_Record-projects-completed_10_Radio-listenership-nationally_2_Relevant-network-connections_16_Genre_rock_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["93"],["903"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",

Both these measures were collected as part of a research study conducted by an international consulting company that aggregated data from thousands of other projects in relevant industries.</p><legend>Instructions</legend></fieldset><fieldset class = 'target'><p>Allocate your budget between the following two projects using percentage values (the two values should sum to 100):</p>" + get_shuffled_table([[["Cweb"],["software"],["Austin, USA"],["vertical"],["centralised"],["<ul><li>Code written: 1000 lines a day<\/li><li>Security rating: 85%<\/li><li>Number of potential customers in first year: 3 million<\/li><li>Target users: enterprise<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"statistics-only_NA_NA_Cweb_software_901_91_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"statistics-only_NA_NA_Cweb_software_901_91_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" name=\"statistics-only_NA_NA_Cweb_software_901_91_Code-written_1000_Security-rating_85_Number-of-potential-customers-in-first-year_3_Target-users_enterprise_target\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["91"],["901"]],[["Refinera"],["oil well"],["Houston, USA"],["horizontal"],["decentralised"],["<ul><li>Oil extracted: 2000L an hour<\/li><li>Time the machinery lasts before requiring maintenance: 7 years<\/li><li>Probability of finding oil: 80%<\/li><li>Type of well: offshore<\/li><\/ul>"],["<p>\n  <p>\n    <label for=\"statistics-only_NA_NA_Refinera_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\">Allocation: <\/label>\n  <\/p>\n  \n  <input type=\"number\" class=\"allocation\" id=\"statistics-only_NA_NA_Refinera_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" name=\"statistics-only_NA_NA_Refinera_oil-well_100_90_Oil-extracted_2000_Time-the-machinery-lasts-before-requiring-maintenance_7_Probability-of-finding-oil_80_Type-of-well_offshore_comparison\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" required style=\"width:70px\"/>\n  \n<\/p>"],["90"],["100"]]], ["Business name","Project type","Location","Integration","Structure","Predicted project features","Project allocation (%)","Overall reliability rating (%)","NPV ($)"], ["Relevant information","Project 1","Project 2"]) + "<legend>Target projects</legend></fieldset>",
