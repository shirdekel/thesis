That baseline is also my determining factor on when the project would get delivered to Production. The noise that isn't relevant for release is if the business line can acquire the 2 or 3 million users needed by EoY 1 (this fact is just noise). There is also nothing stating whether or not the team is better projected to delivering more lines of code being Centralized of Distributed, whether the teams are sliced Horizontal or Vertical. These 2 additional factors, currently, would be considered noise that may not be required. The Codeck project was noted to have 1000 lines of code delivered per day. If the Difference is 20% from Cweb (our baseline), then we would assume we can utilize 20% less resources on Codeck in order to garner the same delivery cycle as we have with Cweb. If that is true, then we can adjust resources and reallocate the remainder to the secondary project and jump start that one as well.""}","","",""

When we looked at the original baseline of Pressbloom, we were given something around 40k with 54 advertisers, which would estimate about a 13.5% per every 1k print. When we looked at the summary, it was something around 30k with around 48 advertising, which we can estimate about a range of 16% per every 1k print. NOW, when we view Grown Media, we see that the 50k prints with the 80 advertising, gives us a match of 16% as well (similar to the 30k prints at 48 advertising). If we know this is true, as well as the ink utilized has a standard % breakdown between the different examples, we can nullify this fact.
