However it does not really explain how or to what degree alternatives in, for example, management, geography (e.g. location, offshore vs onshore), etc. would change or improve outcomes. The amount of variables affecting each oil project would make it hard to use Refinera as a relevant investment guide for an oil project that does not have very similar characteristics, but it can serve to highlight potential red flags.""}","",""
