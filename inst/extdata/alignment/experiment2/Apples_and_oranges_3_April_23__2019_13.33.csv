Project 3 and 5 seem to be products customers tend to spend a lot more on. I believe we should focus on these two projects. Mountaineers, hikers, and bikers tend to spend a lot of money on high quality products (since you don't want some low quality item that would break easily).

Project 2 also seems like a good product but I am unsure how often customers purchase new washing machines. 

Project 4 laptop specs are awful. 250GB is not a lot of space in today's technology. I do not see people wanting to buy a laptop with 768px resolution, 250GB space and 2GB of ram when there are MUCH better laptops (with more space and more ram) already in the market for a reasonable price.
