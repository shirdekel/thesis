As well as seeing the two target projects, you will also be provided with an example of a failed project with some information that was available just before the company decided to invest in it. Further, you are also provided with an analysis of this investment decision after it became clear that the project will not meet its expected return on investment.",

The NPV is the companyâ€™s estimation of the future returns of the project. An NPV that is greater than 0 (zero) indicates that there is an expectation of profit. The higher the NPV, the better the expectations for each project. Both these measures were collected as part of a research study conducted by an international consulting company that aggregated data from thousands of other projects in relevant industries.",
